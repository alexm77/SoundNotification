SoundNotification
=================

For when a visual notification just won't do

Fully configurable, respects your "do not disturb" settings.
The only thing I didn't figure out is how to distinguish silent notification so you don't get notified for those.
I'm using a deprecated mechanism for that, it seems to do the job for now.
